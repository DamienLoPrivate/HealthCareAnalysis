Abstract

We present a review on the effectiveness of healthcare coverage within the United States by analysing correlations between insurance and self reported health status by the IPUMS census database. The study further commented on statistical differences between race, age and gender demographics towards health and coverage through hypothesis testing and visual plots.

We observe a very small correlation between health insurance coverage and improved health outcomes. People who have health insurance typically report being in better overall health by a slight margin, which suggests that having access to healthcare services and having financial security against medical bills may improve people's overall health. Nevertheless, a variety of factors other than insurance coverage may affect health outcomes, as correlation does not imply causation.
